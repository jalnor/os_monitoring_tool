A Python tool that monitors processes as they start and stop. It utilizes a separate subprocess to capture the current running processes, compares those to the database and adds the process or updates its status. It features graphs created with matplotlib and calls to a separate microservice for information about the process. This tool uses Tkinter for the GUI!

## System Requirements
This application uses Python version 3.10 and poetry
